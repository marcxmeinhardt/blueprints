#  ðŸ”¤  Welcome to Blueprints ! 

<br>  
  
### Context  
  
We are trying to build great `products`, `services`, `experiences` and `teams`. 

To do this we need to be `smart`. We need to be `organized`. We need to be `ready`. 

This is a re-organization of our `processes`, `organization` and `infrastructure` from level 0.  

The root of our infrastructure will be setup here, in `Blueprints`.  

Refer to these blueprints to know `why` and `what` we build.
